A alternative way to use default_pages in Plone. 

This package provides a view for folders that redirects the user to the first
item in the folder. 

Managing the view of the redirecting folder is achieved by a dropdownmenu that
links either to folder_contents or to the page that allows you to select a 
different view-method for the redirecting folder.

This way the new default_page will still appear in the navigation and you can
somewaht sanely use folders as default_pages.
